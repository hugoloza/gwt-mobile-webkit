# Introduction #

The key premise of this GWT Mobile WebKit project is to provide for a fully featured toolkit to build mobile webapps. Up to now we have some important HTML5 libraries (Storage, Database and Geolocation) but no UI library. This is about to change with the ideas laid on this page.

The general goal of the Widgets library is to build something useful for at least the iPhone and Android platforms.

# Goals to attain #
  1. Works at least on iPhone and Android
  1. The widgets look like the platform they're running on (iPhone and Android)
  1. The widgets are optimized to use as less Javascript and resources as possible, by using CSS3 animations and styling (e.g. rounded corners, gradients)

# Details #

Generally, the library would contain the following components:
  1. [Panel](http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/Panel.html)s for lists, forms and popups
  1. [[Widget](http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/Widget.html)s for web forms and controls
